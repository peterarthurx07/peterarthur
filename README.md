I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a keen interest in protecting systems, networks, and data from modern threats.  
Currently enrolled in Merit America's Cybersecurity Career Track, I'm building hands-on technical skills in network security, threat detection, and incident response.

With a strong background in logistics, e-commerce management, and digital operations, I bring a unique blend of operational efficiency and security-focused mindset to the cybersecurity field.
